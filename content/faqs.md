# Frequently Asked Questions about the Doctolib Health Satellite Mesh Network

## 1. What is the Doctolib Health Satellite Mesh Network?

The Doctolib Health Satellite Mesh Network is a new service that uses a constellation of satellites positioned above Europe to deliver instant, AI‑driven healthcare consultations. It is designed to serve both people on the ground in Europe and astronauts or crewed missions passing through the space above Europe. By combining satellite infrastructure with medical AI and human clinicians, it offers fast, reliable digital consultations regardless of local internet coverage or geography.

## 2. Who can use the service, and where is it available?

The service is available to residents within Europe and to astronauts or crew members in low‑Earth orbit or other missions flying within the network’s coverage footprint above Europe. Anyone who holds a valid DoctoCard NFT can authenticate and access consultations through the platform. This means it can be used in cities, rural areas, remote research stations, and spacecraft or stations passing over Europe, provided they can connect to the satellite network.

## 3. How does the DoctoCard NFT work?

The DoctoCard NFT is a secure digital token that acts as your key to the Health Satellite Mesh Network. Each DoctoCard represents a unique, verifiable identity, helping ensure that consultations, medical records, and payment rights are correctly linked to you. When you log into the system—whether from Earth or from orbit—you use your DoctoCard NFT to authenticate, after which you can access your health history, schedule or join consultations, and use AI‑powered self‑care tools. Behind the scenes, blockchain technology helps guarantee integrity, traceability, and resistance to tampering.

## 4. How much does a consultation cost, and what are DoctoCoins?

Each consultation on the Doctolib Health Satellite Mesh Network is priced at a flat rate of 100 DoctoCoins. DoctoCoins are the dedicated digital currency used within this ecosystem to simplify payments across borders and environments (Earth and space). This flat pricing makes it easier to budget for healthcare: one standard rate, regardless of where you connect from within the coverage zone. Employers, insurers, research programs, or mission planners can preload DoctoCards with DoctoCoins so that their staff or crew have guaranteed access to care.

## 5. How does AI fit into the consultation process?

AI is used to augment, not replace, human healthcare professionals. The platform’s AI systems handle tasks such as real‑time symptom assessment, triage, risk flagging, and decision support. They can quickly analyze reported symptoms, past history, and contextual factors to suggest likely priorities and next steps. Clinicians remain in control of diagnoses and treatment decisions, using AI as a tool to reduce response times, improve consistency, and ensure nothing critical is overlooked—especially in constrained environments like space missions or remote terrestrial settings.

## 6. How are my data, privacy, and security protected?

The Health Satellite Mesh Network is designed with end‑to‑end security and privacy by design. All data transmitted between your device, the satellites, and ground infrastructure is encrypted. The DoctoCard NFT ensures that only authorized individuals can access specific records, and access to data is strictly logged and governed. Doctolib applies rigorous compliance standards and regularly audits its AI systems and infrastructure to ensure alignment with medical regulations, data‑protection laws, and ethical guidelines. Patients remain in control of their data, with clear consent flows that explain what is collected, how it is used, and with whom it may be shared.
